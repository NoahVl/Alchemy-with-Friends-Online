# 🃏 Alchemy with Friends - Online 🎭

## 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to my "Alchemy with Friends - Online" game! This project started as a fun way to play [Microsoft's Alchemy with Friends](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/Alchemy-with-Friends-Print-at-Home-2020.pdf) with my friends over the internet. However, it can be used to play with any (manually inserted) cards for a fill-in-the-blank style game, similar to popular party games.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay using WebSockets
- Customizable card decks
- Scoreboard resilient to server crashes
- Blank cards for the user to fill in

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a quick project to explore AI-assisted web development. **Please note:** This project should not be hosted in any serious setting as players may be able to manipulate their data and send it to the server. 

The code is not indicative of my web development skills (because it's a mess), but simply to see:
* how far along the technology is to make functional game sites, and
* how quickly I can cobble together an online card-game to enjoy with friends

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python with Flask and Flask-SocketIO
- Real-time Communication: WebSockets

## 🧠 AI Assistance
- Originally written with the help of GitHub Copilot
- Rewritten using [aider](https://aider.chat) to implement WebSockets

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the backend server
3. Open the frontend in a web browser
4. Invite your friends and enjoy!
