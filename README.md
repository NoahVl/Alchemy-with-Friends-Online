# Cards-Against-Humanity-Clone
 My clone of cards against humanity, originally developed to play [Microsoft's Alchemy with Friends](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/Alchemy-with-Friends-Print-at-Home-2020.pdf) with my friends.

This is simply a quick project to try out AI assisted web development. The project should not be hosted in any serious setting as players will likely be able to manipulate their data and send it to the server.

Originally written using the help of Copilot, rewritten using [aider](aider.chat) to use WebSockets.
